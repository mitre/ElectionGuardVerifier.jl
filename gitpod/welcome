Welcome to the MITRE Verifier gitpod.

This environment has been set up so you can try out the verifier yourself

To run the verifier yourself on our sample data, use the command:

gitpod% verify gitpod/example

To run the verifier on the election record from the November 2022 pilot election:

gitpod% verifypilot

Alternatively, if you have a URL for a zipped election record to verify:

gitpod% verifyurl <url>

The verifier will finish its output with "true" if no errors are found in the record.
