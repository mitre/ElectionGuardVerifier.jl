# Try It Out Fast!

If you want to try out the Verifier without installing it using
Gitpod, click
[here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mitre/ElectionGuardVerifier.jl).

This will start a virtual machine that will automatically be set up to
install the Julia programming language and our scripts to simplify
using the verifier.

You will need an account on github.com, and if this is the first time
you're using GitPod you will need to choose an option for which code
editor.  This doesn't really matter--just choose the first option.

The virtual machine provides one processor core.  If you want to make
use of the parallel processing capabilities of the verifier, install
it on a machine that provides multiple processor cores.
